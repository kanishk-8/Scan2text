Scan2text is a repository containing multiple models designed to extract text from images (and PDFs, if needed) and convert it into editable text. Inspired by the Amazon ML Challenge, and while we were only participanting in this challenge, this project showcases a variety of OCR approaches using state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods.

## Models

### Paligemma with Keras
<img src="https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/attention_research_1.png" alt="Paligemma with Keras" height="250">

**Overview:**  
A baseline deep learning model built with Keras. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction followed by sequence modeling layers to quickly transform image features into readable text.

**Key Points:**
- **Simple & Fast:** An initial prototype for OCR tasks.
- **Benchmarking:** Serves as a baseline for comparing more advanced techniques.

**Overview:**  
Utilizes the BERT transformer architecture fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to process raw OCR outputs, identifying and labeling entities such as names, dates, and organizations.

**Key Points:**
- **Context-Aware Refinement:** Corrects misrecognized entities.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Particularly beneficial for documents where entity recognition is critical.

**Overview:**  
A lighter variant of the standard BERT-base model fine-tuned for NER. It strikes a balance between accuracy and inference speed.

**Key Points:**
- **Efficiency:** Ideal for real-time applications or limited-resource environments.
- **Competitive Performance:** Maintains accuracy while speeding up processing.

## Overview:
Scan2text is a repository showcasing multiple approaches to optical character recognition (OCR). While I’m only a participant in the Amazon ML Challenge, this project explores how different models—ranging from CNN-based architectures in Keras to advanced transformer-based techniques like BERT and XLNet—can extract and refine text from images or PDFs. By providing a modular structure, recommended dataset organization, and an array of scripts and notebooks, Scan2text aims to help users experiment with and compare various OCR methods in terms of performance, accuracy, and practical application.
